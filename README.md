# Useful Arduino Sketches

ArduinoISP_NoP.ino - This sketch is a modified version of the standard ArduinoISP.ino that permits the user to program an Atmega328 (without the "P" suffix) and not receive a wrong signature error or require the user to modify the avrdude config file.

ADC_SingleConversion.ino - This sketch demonstrates a single ADC conversion by setting Atmega328 registers directly.
